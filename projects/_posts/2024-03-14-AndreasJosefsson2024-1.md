## Project Description
The aim of this project is to explore the potential of digital pathology to perform automatic scoring of the immunohistochemistry markers Ki-67 and PSA in prostate cancer biopsies. The material used is annotated stained slides of biopsies and the aim is to develop a algorithm with equal performance as the pathologist scoring.
