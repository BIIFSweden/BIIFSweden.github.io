## Project Description
 Stem cell therapy has been proposed as an option to treat sensorineural hearing loss since auditory system as well as the most of the central nervous system has a limited regenerative potential. The treatment of neurodegenerative diseases has been studied through the cell-based approach over the past years. Replacement of the damaged spiral ganglion neurons in the inner ear, the first-order neurons of the auditory pathway, with precursor cells would be a way to improve hearing function in patients with malfunctions of the auditory system including patients in need of a cochlear implant. In our project we use mouse organotypic auditory brainstem slice culture as a screening platform for donor cells differentiation potential to further proceed with in vivostudies.
