## Project Description
 The aim of the project is to estimate the degree of infiltration of T cells in thyroid glands of chicken in order to <br/><br/>better understand auto-immunity and rare genetic disease. We have developed an image analysis pipeline, using ilastik, CellProfiler, and some Python scripts, that <br/><br/>extracts the regions of interest from the full glass slide images and classifies the tissue into infiltration or normal. The whole dataset contained 558 slides and <br/><br/>the analysis was run on a powerful local server at the BMC.
