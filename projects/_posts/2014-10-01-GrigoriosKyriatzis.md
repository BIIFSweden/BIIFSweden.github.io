## Project Description
 he aim of the project is to interpret differences in migration-proliferation of cells with different <br/><br/>treatments and express those in a quantitative manner. We used a 'scratch assay' approach, or 'wound healing assay' as it sometimes is called, where cells are <br/><br/>grown in wells, and then the surface is 'scratched' and loose cells are washed away. Then the wells are imaged, possibly followed by adding a drug substance, and <br/><br/>imaging the wells again at a suitable time interval. The area filled at time point T is a measure of the migration speed.
