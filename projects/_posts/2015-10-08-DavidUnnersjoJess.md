## Project Description
 Our collaborators have developed a super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy protocol for the study of <br/><br/>the filtration barrier in the kidney. The aim of the project is to quantitatively evaluate the morphology and topology of the glomerular filtration barrier in the <br/><br/>kidney.
