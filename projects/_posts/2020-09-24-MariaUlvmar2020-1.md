excerpt: "Lymph node tumor metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors in human cancer and correlate with an increased risk for further metastatic spread in several types of cancer, including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, which are tumor types we focus on in our studies. We have identified cancer-induced vascular changes that can provide value as biomarkers. To evaluate this further we aim to develop new automated image analysis tools to recognize and characterize changes of the vasculature in biobank lymph node samples from patients with different types of cancer and invasiveness."

## Project Description
Lymph node tumor metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors in human cancer and correlate with an increased risk for further metastatic spread in several types of cancer, including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, which are tumor types we focus on in our studies. We have identified cancer-induced vascular changes that can provide value as biomarkers. To evaluate this further we aim to develop new automated image analysis tools to recognize and characterize changes of the vasculature in biobank lymph node samples from patients with different types of cancer and invasiveness.
