## Project Description
 We developed double resin casting micro computed tomography (DUCT) as a new tool to visualize and automatically quantify the architecture of lumenized systems in vivo in tandem. We applied this novel tool to study the vascular and biliary systems in the liver of a mouse model for Alagille syndrome. Together with CEITEC and SciLife Biomimage-informartics we created a fully automated pipeline to analyze length, volume, tortuosity, branching, and the relation between the vascular and biliary systems. Application of DUCT to a mouse model for Alagille syndrome, revealed novel architectural defects that would not be discovered using traditional 2D imaging techniques.
