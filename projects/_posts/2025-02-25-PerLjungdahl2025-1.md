## Project Description
We have used intra vital 2-photon microscopy combined with a customized spatial transcriptomics approach to study the virulence properties of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Using mice as models, we have imaged the colonization of kidneys by fungal cells in real time in a living infected host. The aim of this project is to quantitatively evaluate the transcriptional response of the host and pathogen in kidneys from mice previously imaged. Our goal is to obtain a detailed understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that are engaged during virulent growth.
