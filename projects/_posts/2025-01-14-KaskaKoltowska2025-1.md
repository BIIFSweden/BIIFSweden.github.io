## Project Description
In this project, we are creating zebrafish xenografts by transplanting glioblastoma patient-derived cell lines tagged with GFP into Tg(kdrl:mcherry) zebrafish embryos. By observing the interplay of the tumour with the blood vessels and the cell dynamics, we aim to characterize the different glioblastoma invasion patterns.
