## Project Description
 Adipocytes store lipids, predominantly triglycerides (TGs), in lipid droplets (LDs). Upon energy shortage, TGs are hydrolyzed into non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol in an enzymatic process termed lipolysis. LDs are highly dynamic and undergo fragmentation or fusion under lipolytic and lipogenic conditions, respectively. The aim of this project is to unravel the molecular mechanisms governing LD formation and investigate connections between LD morphology and lipolysis rate. We will perform a high throughput image analysis of TG (BODIPY)-stained adipocytes treated with siRNAs that target lipolysis regulating genes. Images will be acquired by an automated microphotography pipeline. Using the proposed image analysis, we aim to quantitatively measure the effects on LD morphology and lipolysis rate for each gene. The results from this screen are compared with clinical measures in our cross-sectional and prospective cohorts. This will constitute an invaluable resource for in-depth and hypothesis-driven analyses, which will improve our understanding of the mechanisms controlling human adipocyte lipolysis.
