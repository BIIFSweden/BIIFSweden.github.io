## Project Description
 Our collaborators newly established an way of <br/><br/>staining the activity in the endogenous opioid system in the rat spinal cord, and the aim of the project is to quantify the ammount and localization of mRNA <br/><br/>staining. We have developed image analysis approaches for quantifying the amount of cells with positive signals and associate those to manually outlined regions of <br/><br/>interest within the spinal cord of rats. We have applied our new method for local adaptive thresholding based on ellipse fit to segment nuclei, and use ilastik to <br/><br/>classify positive/negative cells.
