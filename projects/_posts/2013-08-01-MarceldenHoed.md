## Project Description
 The aim of this project is to identify novel targets for the therapeutic intervention of coronary <br/><br/>artery disease. This is done by following-up results from genome-wide association studies in epidemiological studies using a zebrafish model system. Using image <br/><br/>analysis we try to identify and characterize causal genes within loci that have so far been identified as associated with coronary heart disease by (high-throughput) <br/><br/>screening of atherogenic processes in wildtype and mutant zebrafish, both before and after feeding on a control diet or a diet high in cholesterol. Using confocal <br/><br/>microscopy we can image fat accumulation in the zebrafish. We have also developed methods for length and volume measurements as well as quantification of <br/><br/>macrophages, neutrophils, IK17 and the overlap with these expressions and stationary lipids. Our results confirm that zebrafish larvae represent a promising model <br/><br/>system for early-stage atherosclerosis.
