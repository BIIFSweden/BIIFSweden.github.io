## Project Description
 The aim of this project is to establish a standardised method for measuring cell and axonal <br/><br/>growth from spinal cord slice cultures. To measure the area of axons outside the explant body, pictures of spinal cord slice <br/><br/>cultures are captured through a light microscope and then analysed in ImageJ and CellProfiler. Our plan is to use this method in future experiments on axonal <br/><br/>regeneration and growth from the spinal cord. <br/><br/>
