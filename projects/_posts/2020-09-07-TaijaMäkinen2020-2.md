title: "Quantification of vessel and vessel lumen area in tissue sections"

excerpt: "In a list of fluorescent images of mouse lymph nodes, we want to measure the total area of the lymph nodes, the total area of lymphatic vessels and the total area of the lumen within the lymphatic vessels. The images are acquired using four different fluorescent stains: DAPI, GFP, VEGFR2 and Lyve-1."

## Project Description
The aim of the project is to create an ImageJ macro that can be used to measure three different areas in confocal images of tissue sections; (1) the whole section area, (2) the vessel area and (3) the lumen area within the vessels. The researcher provides a .lif file with merged tilescan images in four channels: Channel 1: DAPI stain; Channel 2: GFP reporter; Channel 3: LYVE1 stain and Channel 4: VEGFR2 stain. An overlay of all four channels is used to measure the total area. From the overlay of all four channels, all the lumens (=areas with no staining) that are located within the vessels (Channels 3-4) is measured. An overlay of channels 3-4 are used to measure the vessel area. The macro creates a result folder containing a .csv file with the measurements, a TIF file with the maximum projection image and a TIF file with the masked measurement areas in RGB (see Figure above).
