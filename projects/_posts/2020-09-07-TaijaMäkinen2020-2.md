## Project Description
In a list of fluorescent images of mouse lymph nodes, we want to measure the total area of the lymph nodes, the total area of lymphatic vessels and the total area of the lumen within the lymphatic vessels. The images are acquired using four different fluorescent stains: DAPI, GFP, VEGFR2 and Lyve-1.

The DAPI stain is used for lymph node segmentation, while the three other stains are used for lymphatic vessels segmentation. All stains are merged together for lumen segmentation.
