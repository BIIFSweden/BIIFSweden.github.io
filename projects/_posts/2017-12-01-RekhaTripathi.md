## Project Description
 The goal of this project is to analyze protein translation rate in mouse primary cortical neurons and astrocytes. The aim is to assess the protein synthesis by using the OPP Kit in primary cortical cultures of wild type and SLC38A10-/- Knockout mice. To understand role of SLC38A10 in protein regulation in neurons and astrocytes. We are using Cell Profiler to measure fluorescence intensity.
