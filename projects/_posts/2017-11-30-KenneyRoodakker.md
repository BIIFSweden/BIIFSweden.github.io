## Project Description
 Gliomas are heterogeneous tumors in terms of imaging appearances, and a deeper understanding of the histopathological tumor characteristics that underlie the signal abnormalities on PET and MRI is needed. Here we used histology-to-radiology co-registration of gliomas with the aim to correlate local changes in tumor perfusion and 11C-methionine uptake with cell density, vascularity and proliferation in these areas.
