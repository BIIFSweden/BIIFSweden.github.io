## Project Description
Microtubules are protein filaments that make up the mitotic spindle during chromosome segregation. Plus end-binding proteins (+TIP) regulate MT stability and facilitate interactions with other proteins in order for proper segregation to occur. One such +TIP, BIK1, exists in several distinct pools within the cell: A mobile cytoplasmic pool at astral microtubules emanating from the spindle pole body and a stable nuclear pool localised close to the SPB and kinetochores. The cytoplasmic pool of BIK1 has been extensively described in itâ€™s role during spindle positioning. By contrast, the function, dynamics and regulation of nuclear BIK1 remains unclear. We recently identified BIK1 in a screen searching for proteins with age-dependent subcellular localisation. We are now characterising nuclear BIK1 localisation thoughout the cell cycle and its function by combining widefield microscopy and yeast genetics techniques.
