## Project Description
The Human Developmental Cell Atlas (HDCA) is a Swedish initiative within the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), one of the largest international scientific projects. The project aim is to create a comprehensive molecular atlas of human prenatal development, describing every cell type in detail and showing their spatial and temporal distributions in three dimensions. Each cell’s molecular signature will provide deeper insight into how variations and deviations contribute to health and disease. In addition, the atlas will allow us to identify exactly where and when disease-associated genes are active in our body and analyze the regulatory mechanisms that create organs and tissues. 

The Facility is providing the visualization tool (TissUUmaps) and support to share data online.
