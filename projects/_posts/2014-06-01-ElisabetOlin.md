## Project Description
 In this project we analyze vascular networks in the mouse brain, retina networks and cell junction <br/><br/>activations. We have several applications where we skeletonize the networks and extract branch points in the skeleton. For the cell junction activations we have <br/><br/>initially used an approach where we compute the area of the activated junctions (green) between the cells and use that as a measurement of <br/><br/>activation.
