## Project Description
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the cortex brain stem and spinal chord. The incidence is 1 in 50 000 <br/><br/>combining US and EU populations. The disease is fatal in approximately 5 years and there is currently no cure for AL. Morover, given the low incidence of case, <br/><br/>finding new treatments for ALS is not a priority of the Pharma industry. At SciLifeLab, we are developing several image based assays to discover strategies that can <br/><br/>alleviate the death of ALS-motor neurons.
