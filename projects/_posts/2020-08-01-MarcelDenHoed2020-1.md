## Project Description
The den Hoed research group at IGP has acquired imaging data for traits related to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in >25,000 larvae since 2014. Image analysis pipelines have previously been developed for these traits by the BioImage Informatics facility. In 2020, the group acquired a second imaging setup, and both imaging setups are now fully automated. The automation implies that images are acquired differently now, including larger z-stacks, lower magnification for some readouts, larger field of view, new camera and integrated deblurring of background. This new fully automatic acquisition pipeline requires new robust methods for the analysis and quantification of larvae.
