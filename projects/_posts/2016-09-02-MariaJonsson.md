## Project Description
 Wnt/beta-catenin signaling <br/><br/>is involved in proliferation and fate of cells thus playing fundamental roles during embryo development. The specific aims of this part of the EU project are to 1) <br/><br/>develop methods for detection of chemically induced changes in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and to 2) determine developmental effects of EDC mixtures on <br/><br/>Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. EDC-induced changes in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are visualized and studied by transgenic zebrafish carrying a beta-catenin signaling <br/><br/>fluorescent reporter (Tcf/Lef-miniP: d2EGFP).
