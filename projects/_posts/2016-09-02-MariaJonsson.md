## Project Description
 Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is involved in proliferation and fate of cells thus playing fundamental roles during embryo development. The specific aims of this part of the EU project are to 1) develop methods for detection of chemically induced changes in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and to 2) determine developmental effects of EDC mixtures on Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. EDC-induced changes in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are visualized and studied by transgenic zebrafish carrying a beta-catenin signaling fluorescent reporter (Tcf/Lef-miniP: d2EGFP).
