## Project Description
The major aim in this project is to modify an existing comet pipeline developed for Cell Profiler in order to use it for automatic microscopy and image analysis of DNA strand breaks in “tricky” single cells using our recently presented version of the Comet assay (the Flash Comet). The comets with their tails represent cells with different levels of DNA damage, and in this project some of the comets we would like to analyze have tails which normally can not be handled by commercial software’s more commonly used in the Comet assay.
