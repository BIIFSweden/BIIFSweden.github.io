## Project Description
Fra-1, a member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family, is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our group has identified in previous research that there are 118 proteins interact with endogenous chromatin-bound Fra-1 in TNBC cells, PARP-1 is one of them. PARP-1(Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) is an ADP-ribosyl transferase which can deliver ADP-ribose units from donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to different target proteins or to itself. We want to know whether PARP1 correlated with Fra-1 in patients’ samples and the distribution of PARP-1 in different subtypes of breast cancers. Then we conduct immunofluorescence staining with breast cancer tissues.  For the breast cancer tissue microarrays (US BioMax, BR1503e), we performed immunofluorescence staining. Images were captured separately using Nikon high speed spinning disk microscope. Pictures are normalized by Image J and data analysis was performed by Prism. We detected PARP-1 and Fra-1 protein levels in breast cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue by immunofluorescence staining of tissue microarrays (TMAs). The PARP-1 is mainly expressed in nuclear, and we want to explore the correlation between PARP-1 and Fra-1 so we only focus on the nuclear expression when we analysis the result. As the result showed, PARP-1 is overexpressed in basal like breast cancer compared with normal breast tissue (P = 0,0183), and luminal A subtype (P = 0,0506) which has same pattern with mRNA expression. Fra-1 is also overexpressed in basal like breast cancer compared with normal breast tissue (P = 0,0156), and luminal A (P = 0,0452). There was no difference of PARP-1 expression between normal breast tissue and the other tumor subtypes, no difference between each stage, subtypes and biomarkers, neither of Fra-1. Then we further explored whether there is correlation between PARP-1 and Fra-1. Strikingly, PARP-1 is correlated with Fra-1 expression (r = 0,8840, P < 0,0001).
