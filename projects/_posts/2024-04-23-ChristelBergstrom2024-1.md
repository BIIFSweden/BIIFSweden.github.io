## Project Description
Nanoparticles as carriers of drug would diffuse in different speed depending on the interaction with the medium. In the colonic environment, one of the barriers would be the colonic mucus and we are interested in investigating how the drug would be moving around in the mucus. We aim to capture the diffusivity based on the mean squared displacement of the particle, and therefore the improvement of particle tracking as the input parameter for other mathematical analyses is essential.
