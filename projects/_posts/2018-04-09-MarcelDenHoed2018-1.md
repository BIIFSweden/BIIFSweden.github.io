## Project Description
Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci that are robustly associated with blood cell count. Identifying and characterizing causal genes in these loci using in vivo model systems is anticipated to shed light on the biological regulation of red blood cell biogenesis and regulation. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an attractive vertebrate animal model to study erythrocytes, thanks to recent developments in automated handling. This allows high-throughput, image-based genetic screens. A transgenic zebrafish line has been obtained with fluorescently labeled erythrocytes (gata1:dsRed). The current project aims to quantify red blood cell count using videos acquired in the dorsal artery and caudal vein.
