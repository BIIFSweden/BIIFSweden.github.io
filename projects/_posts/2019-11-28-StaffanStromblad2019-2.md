## Project Description
The project addresses the role of a member of a serine/threonine kinase in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression. This kinase is overexpressed in a small fraction of pancreatic cancer patients and its expression is linked to poor patient outcome; however, the mechanisms by which it promotes tumor development are not fully understood. Here we aim to clarify the functional role of this enzyme in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma development and progression.
