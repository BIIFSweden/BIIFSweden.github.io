## Project Description
In this project, our aims are to investigate the expression of several biomarkers in different subtypes of lymphoma and characterize the interaction between immune cells and tumor cells in microenvironment and correlate with clinical data. In addition, we will to map the distance between immune cells and tumor cells and investigate any correlation with clinical parameters.
