title: "Immunoprofiling of different subtypes of lymphoma using multiplex immunofluorescence"

excerpt: "Competition with unshod horses is an important and hot topic in harness racing in Sweden. The performance, when racing unshod, improve markedly compared to the shod condition but trainers and owners are also aware of that it does not always work out well. There might be several reasons for failure, one being that the ”balance” (locomotion symmetry in high speed) of the horse is negatively affected, another that there is pain from the hooves or the distal phalanges. The latter is of course not acceptable. However, the apparent simple solution just to ban unshod racing can be a mistake from a long term health perspective since many horses actually have hooves that are robust enough to withstand high speed exercise without shoes. These hooves have qualities that should be sought for and these individuals should be used in breeding. For centuries, the use of shoes have probably impaired the quality of hooves in the domesticated horse and there is time to do something about it."

## Project Description
In this project, our aims are to investigate the expression of several biomarkers in different subtypes of lymphoma and characterize the interaction between immune cells and tumor cells in microenvironment and correlate with clinical data. In addition, we will to map the distance between immune cells and tumor cells and investigate any correlation with clinical parameters.
