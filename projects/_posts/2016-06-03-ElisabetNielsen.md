## Project Description
 In vitro methods are often <br/><br/>used to study the concentration-effect relationship for antimicrobial agents. Time-kill curve experiments have long been the standard methodology, with bacterial <br/><br/>counts followed over time using viable count assessments on agar plates. This method is labor-intensive and recently digital time-lapse microscopy methods have <br/><br/>become available which might allow a more rapid assessment of antibiotic activity. Additionally, these methods could add information related to drug-induced <br/><br/>morphological changes. The aim of this project is to integrate information obtained from time-lapse microscopy in the characterization of antibiotic effect on <br/><br/>bacterial growth and morphology.
