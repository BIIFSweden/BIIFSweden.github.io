## Project Description
 The outcome of islet transplantation has improved progressively. However, the lack of organ donors makes islet transplantation available only to patients with type I diabetes with the most severe glycemic lability. In the clinic, a second transplantation is often required to boost graft function and extend the time until recurrence of insulin dependence. In this study, we aimed to, in a mouse model with GFP positive islets, investigate if the repeated islet infusion procedure itself has a positive effect on islet engraftment in the liver.
