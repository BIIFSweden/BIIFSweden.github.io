## Project Description
 The goal of this project is to analyze neurons grown from stem cells in vitro. The aim is to assess the percentage of neurons <br/><br/>(using B-tubulin) and certain neuron subtypes (GABA) by immunofluorescence. We used CellProfiler to segment the cells and CellProfiler Analyst to classify positive <br/><br/>cells.
