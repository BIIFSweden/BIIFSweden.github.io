## Project Description
 Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EH) is a rare genetic skin disorder caused by mutation of keratin 1 or <br/><br/>10, and characterized by blistering in the epidermis and hyperkeratosis. The skin may blister easily following mechanical injury and exposure to heat etc. <br/><br/>Immortalized keratinocyte cell lines were established by our collaborators at the Dept. of Medical Sciences, Dermatology and Venereology, and these cell lines show <br/><br/>promise as a screening model to test new potential drugs for treating EH patients. Large-scale screening requires robust, efficient and effective image analysis <br/><br/>methods, and we are currently developing methods to analyze keratin aggregates in cultured EH cells. The project resulted in a publication: H. Zhang, M. Ericsson, M. Virtanen, S. Westr&ouml;m, C. W&auml;hlby, A. Vahlquist and H. T&ouml;rm&auml;.
