## Project Description
 Ubiquitin is a small protein that is found in almost all cellular tissues in humans and other eukaryotic <br/><br/>organisms, which helps to regulate the processes of other proteins in the body. Cultured cells respond to treatments such as silencing of genes or exposure to <br/><br/>radiation and/or drugs by changing their morphology, giving us hints on mechanisms of action. We develop methods for image-based high-throughput screening to <br/><br/>identify subtle changes in individual cells, not accessible by bulk-methods, here focusing on the ubiquitin pathway.
