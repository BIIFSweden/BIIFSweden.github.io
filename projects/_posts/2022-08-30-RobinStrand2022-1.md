## Project Description
In this project, we are looking at combining deep learning (DL) segmentation models with interactive refinement to improve the segmentation of structures like glioblastoma and aneurysms in MRI images. An existing Python-based segmentation tool, https://github.com/FredrikNysjo/ichseg , will be  extended so that it can be used as a GUI for editing the segmentation masks of the DL models.
