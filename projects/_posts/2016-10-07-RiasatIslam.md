## Project Description
 The main goal of this study was to develop a platform for quantifying the <br/><br/>tumor-initiating capacity of a large panel of glioma-stem cell cultures (GSCs) in adult mouse brain to define the cancer stem-cell like property of the individual <br/><br/>cultures and to integrate the result with genomic and transcriptional profiling of the GSCs. In order to achieve this, adherently grown GFP-luciferase GSC cultures <br/><br/>were dissociated and injected stereotactically into the brain of immunodeficient mice. Tumor growth was monitored in vivo by bioluminescence imaging for up to 40 <br/><br/>weeks and brains were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemical stainings. Automatic quantification and growth pattern analysis of tumor cells in brain <br/><br/>sections was set up based on human cell specific staining using NuMa antibodies and a CellProfiler Analyst machine learning classifier with a manual observer <br/><br/>correlation of 0.86. Tumors were identified in brains from mice injected with 15/29 GSC cultures, suggesting these cells as a valuable resource for future <br/><br/>preclinical therapeutic studies targeting predicted vulnerabilities for individual glioma patients.
