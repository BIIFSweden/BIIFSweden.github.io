## Project Description
The genetic material of the cell is organized in a highly regulated and dynamic manner inside the nucleus. DNA folding changes throughout the cell cycle and is closely linked to processes such as transcription and replication. Recent studies have identified the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex cohesin as a key regulator of chromosome organization. This is thought to occur through loop extrusion, whereby DNA is organized into cis-interacting domains. The goal of this project is study chromosome organization in live cells and to understand how the spatial organization is affected by inactivation of SMC complexes. We have introduced Lac and Tet operator repeats in yeast chromosomes. Fluorescently tagged Lac and Tet repressors allow us to visualize these specific genomic loci in live cells. We are combining this labelling technique with live cell imaging and single particle tracking to follow chromosome organization in different mutant strains and drug treatments. With the help of the BIIF we are developing an analysis pipeline to track intrachromosomal distances over time in live cells.
