Dear All,

Welcome to the latest edition of the BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) newsletter! 

## Call4Help
The next Call4Help session is coming up next **Tuesday, December 5, 9:30 â€“ 11:30**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/call4help-form/).
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.   
The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project. For this we team-up with Sylvie Le Guyader, Head of the [LCI Microscopy Facility, KI](https://ki.se/en/bionut/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci?pk_vid=edc74ddcac41efbf16964996865aa670). 

## TissUUmaps ![TissUUmaps logo](/images/TissUUmaps_logo.png )
**We are thrilled to announce the release of TissUUmaps version 3.2!**  

Here are the **key highlights**:
 - New Annotation Tools: Developed in collaboration with Sanofi Digital R&D. You can now draw and edit regions in a faster and more intuitive way.
 - Improved region rendering performance: you can now load thousands of regions without any performance issues.
 - Enhanced Region Tab: We've completely refactored the region tab to efficiently handle large number of items, including detailed analysis of individual regions.
 - GeoJSON Import and Geobuf (.pbf) Support: Import regions from multiple GeoJSON files and leverage Geobuf (.pbf) region files for larger dataset.
 - Advanced Marker Options: Customize markers with new outline and fill options.
 - Better drag-and-drop support in the Qt version.
 - Validation of .tmap Files: Ensure better compatibility with .tmap file validation through tissuumaps-schema.
 - New installers for macOS (.dmg) and Linux (.deb) in addition to the old Windows installer.
