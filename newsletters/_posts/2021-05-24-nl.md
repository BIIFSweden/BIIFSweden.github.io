Dear All,  

Next weekâ€™s Call-4-Help session will be a tool-presentation on [QuPath]( https://qupath.github.io/). QuPath is a free and open-source software tool especially well suited for digital pathology, e.g. analyzing large tissue data of H&E stains or multiplexed fluorescence microscopy. The webinar in which we will showcase QuPath will take place Tuesday, June 1, 2021 9:00 -  10:00  and there will be plenty of room for questions and discussions. You can find more information and the link to register [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/event/bioimage-informatics-call4help-12/).
Also, please note that we have several positions coming up in the next months. Please check our [homepage]( https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/bioimage-informatics/) for more news.
