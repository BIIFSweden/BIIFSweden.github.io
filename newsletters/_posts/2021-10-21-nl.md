Dear All,

please join our upcoming [Call4Help webinar](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/bioimage-informatics-call4help-5/)! For this session we are organizing a tool-presentation seminar about [CellPose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose), a generalist algorithm for cell and nuclei segmentation. **CellPose is a deep learning-based segmentation method** trained on a wide range of image types. It can be applied to both 2D and 3D images. During this seminar we will explore different ways to run CellPose, including demos powered by the **[ImJoy](https://imjoy.io/)** server which aim to make it easier for users to analyse large datasets in computing clusters. The webinar will be given by **Gisele Miranda (BIIF) and Wei Ouyang (KTH, developer of ImJoy)** and will take place on **November 2nd, 09:00-10:00**. There will be time for questions and discussion, so we hope this event to be very interactive. Please register [here](https://forms.gle/AxaaShMwY4hdkGsX6).

Best regards  
Anna
