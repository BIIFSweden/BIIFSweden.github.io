Dear All,

welcome to our latest BIIF newsletter! Many exciting events happened in the end of 2024 and we started 2025 with many new ideas and projects.

## Hackathons & Conferences
### OME-NGFF, Nextflow Hackathons

### European Society for Spatial Biology - Inaugural Conference
The [European Society for Spatial Biology](https://spatialbiologysociety.eu/) had their inaugural conference in Berlin with over 500 participants and 2 days of exciting talks, posters, and industry presenations on the technical advancements and applications in the field. Carolina gave a keynote lectore on spatial biology image analysis in her reserach group, the [TissUUmaps](https://tissuumaps.github.io/) team, and BIIF. 

### LCI course
The LCI course [From sample preparation to image analysis](https://ki.se/en/research/research-infrastructure-and-environments/core-facilities-for-research/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci/lci-microscopy-course) is running at the moment. All lectures are broadcasted live annd accessbile to anyone. Find the full schedule [here](https://ki.se/media/270614/download). Agus' lecture "Introduction to Bioimage analysis" will take place Feb 13, 9:10.

## GloBIAS YouTube channel
GloBIAS - the Global BioImage Analysts' Society - has uploaded many relevant videos on its' [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GloBIAS/videos). You will find recordings of the first workshop that was hold last year in November in Göteborg, e.g. the video of Agus on his view on [navigating new knowledge in a multidisciplinary field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKQ2OsPboi0). Also uploaded are recordings of the [GloBIAS seminar series](https://www.globias.org/activities/bia-seminar-series) - e.g. an introduction to Large Language Models for BioImage Analysis. 

## Ai4Life - Artifical Intelligence for Image Data Analysis in The Life Sciences
In 2024, BIIF became a partner within the [Ai4Life project](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/). The project is Horizon Europe funded and aims to empower life science researchers to harness the full potential of AI and Machine Learning methods for bioimage analysis. Kristína and Agus are working on several projects, providing image analysis solutions to the researchers. You can join 4 webinars, jointly organized by Ai4Life and GloBIAS, showcasing the AI4Life services. More information [here](https://bsky.app/profile/ai4life.bsky.social/post/3lgsoepv4gs2x).

## Publication with BIIF support
The study [Liver X receptor unlinks intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08247-6) led by Eduardo Villablanca, was published in Nature, November 2024. BIIF-support by Christophe enabled the segmentation of ducts in histological images using Deep Learning. Read more about the project on our [project website](https://biifsweden.github.io/projects/2023/08/07/EduardoVillablanca2023-1/) and explore the code on our [public GitHub repo of the project](https://github.com/BIIFSweden/EduardoVillablanca2023-1).
