Dear All,

Welcome to the latest edition of the BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) newsletter! 

## Call4Help

The next Call4Help session is coming up next Tuesday - **October 10, 9:30 â€“ 11:30**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/call4help-form/).
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.   
The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project. For this we team-up with Sylvie Le Guyader, Head of the [LCI Microscopy Facility, KI](https://ki.se/en/bionut/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci?pk_vid=edc74ddcac41efbf16964996865aa670).

### BIIF Secures Extended Support from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative

The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) has renewed the **Imaging Scientist grant for Gisele Miranda** to support her work at the BioImage Informatics facility (SciLifeLab) and the Live Cell Imaging facility (KI). The grant aims to increase interactions between biologists and technology experts by funding Imaging Scientists employed in imaging core facilities. In 2021, Gisele was awarded an Imaging Scientist grant together with 15 other scientists across the globe who work with technology development in microscopy and data analysis. Gisele has a background in Computer Science and Applied Biological Sciences, and she has been working in the intersection of computer science and biology on multidisciplinary research projects in the biomedical field.  
Gisele also joined the **CZI Annual Imaging Meeting** in July 2023, which brought together grantees from the different CZI imaging programs, as well as representatives of the Global BioImaging, BioImaging North America, African BioImaging Consortium and other imaging network organizations around the globe. It was an excellent forum for networking across platforms, community building to address challenges in the imaging field and dissemination of imaging technologies.
