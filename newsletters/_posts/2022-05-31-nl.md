## Call4Help

The next Call4Help session is coming up next Tuesday - **June 7, 9:00 – 12:00**, information [here](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/bioimage-analysis-support-call4help-5/). If you want to participate, please register to the event until **Friday lunch time** so that we can notify you before the long weekend.

Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project.

BIIF within NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) and with the Human Developmental Cell Atlas is organizing a workshop on Spatial Omics Data Analysis. The workshop provides resources to advanced tools for analysis of spatial datasets via a series of online lectures and computer practicals.  
**More information and application [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/event/spatial-omics-data-analysis/).  
Date: August 29 – September 3**

## I2K recordings
The "From Images to Knowledge" virtual conference took place beginning of May. There have been a series of interesting talks and workshops on bioimage analysis.
Most of the events have been recorded and uploaded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMBPBsR9WmzgefQWEyxfomg) - a great resource which we highly recommend to have a look on.
