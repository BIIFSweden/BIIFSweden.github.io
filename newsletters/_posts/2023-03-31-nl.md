Dear All,

registration to the EMBO Practical Course, co-organized by BIIF, is open! I am really looking forward to this course, as it will cover fantastic topics, all including hands-on exercises.
Details see below.

## Call4Help
The next Call4Help session is coming up next Tuesday - **April 4, 10 â€“ 12am**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/call4help-form/). The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project.  
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis. 

## Courses
### EMBO Practical Course: Advanced methods in bioimage analysis
This advanced course concentrates on teaching cutting-edge concepts and tools for quantitative image analysis and will seek to upgrade the competencies of future bioimage analysis experts on both theoretical algorithm advancements as well as on practical implementation skills.
Modules/resources that will be covered:

*	Microscopy image quality control and image restoration
*	Advanced image segmentation and complex cell phenotyping
*	Handling large microscopy images (such as whole slide scans) and big N-dimensional data 
*	Neural-networks for image restoration, segmentation, and object classification.
*	Co-localisation and spatial statistics
*	Train the trainer: how to teach image analysis

**Dates**: September 10-15, 2023  
**Location**: EMBL Heidelberg, Germany
## Publications

We are happy to have contributed to the study **A topographic atlas defines developmental origins of cell heterogeneity in the human embryonic lung**, 
published in Nature Cell Biology. 
[Read here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36646791/) to learn about building a spatiotemporal atlas of the human embryonic lung and the identification of novel cell types and interactions. 
You can interact with the data using TissUUmaps on https://hdca-sweden.scilifelab.se/tissues-overview/lung/

Best regards  
Anna, in behalf of BIIF
