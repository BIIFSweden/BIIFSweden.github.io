## Call4Help

The next Call4Help session is coming up next Tuesday - **May 3, 9:00 – 12:00**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/event/bioimage-analysis-support-call4help-4/).
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project.


## Courses

### Save the date: Spatial Omics Data Analysis, August 29 – September 3
BIIF within NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) and with the Human Developmental Cell Atlas is organizing a course on **Spatial Omics Data Analysis**. The course will be an online course, held from **August 29 – September 3 2022**. We will be sending more information in upcoming newsletters – please save the date!



## Conferences/Presentations

### From Images to Knowledge (I2K) – Registration open
The 2022 virtual event “From Images to Knowledge (I2K)”, to be held from May 6th, 9th and 10th, will feature talks and in-depth interactive workshops covering state-of-the-art open-source solutions for biological image reconstruction and analysis, as well as social interaction between developers, researchers, and students. More information: [https://coba-nih.github.io/i2kconference/]( https://coba-nih.github.io/i2kconference/).  
Within I2K, **Carolina Wählby** will be presenting **TissUUMaps** on **May 10, 4:00 pm (CEST)** – please have a look!

### BNMI symposium – Bridging the Nordic Microscopy Infrastructure

The Bridging Nordic Microscopy Infrastructures network (BNMI)  is a collaboration between Nordic imaging infrastructures that aims to enhance interactions between the different infrastructures and countries, increase visibility of the available infrastructures and create interactive networks in life science imaging.
The first meeting of the BNMI network will take place at the University of Iceland in Reykjavík, Iceland August 17-19, 2022. The abstract submission deadline is approaching – May 1, 2022.
More information: [https://bnmi.hi.is/]( https://bnmi.hi.is/)


## Apply for NBIS Bioinformatics Long-term Support 
The Bioinformatics Long-term Support offers extensive bioinformatics support to a limited set of scientifically outstanding projects. This support has been enabled primarily by a generous grant from Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW). The idea is simple: A senior bioinformatician will work in your project 500 hours for free.
Deadline of the current round: 6 May 2022
More information [here](www.nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php?form=longterm).

## QuPath news + image analysis textbook

There is a lot happening with QuPath (http://qupath.github.io) and generally image analysis by the developer, Pete Bankhead. Pete has released a **new image analysis textbook** which we highly recommend to have a look on: https://bioimagebook.github.io
There are also two new positions to join him in the QuPath development (see [here]( https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/3974) and [here]( https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/4009)).
