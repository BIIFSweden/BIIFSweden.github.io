Dear All,  

in this month's newsletter we want to particularly draw you attention to mentioning BIIF in the acknowledgments.

## Acknowledging BIIF
It is crucial to us that you acknowledge BIIF when you submit a manuscript that includes a project for which you have received our support. Please let us know before submission and refer to us as *‘BioImage Informatics Facility funded by SciLifeLab, National Microscopy Infrastructure, NMI (VR-RFI 2019-00217), and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative’*. Note that this is an updated reference to us, including all our funding sources. 

## NEUBIAS Academy
