We are welcoming Agustín Corbat within BIIF!  
Agus obtained a PhD in Physics at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is an expert in microscopy and image analysis, with a focus on programming bioimage analysis workflows in Python. You will see him both at the IT Department in Uppsala and SciLifeLab Campus Solna -  don't hesitate to get in contact with him!

## Longitude prize for Sysmec Astrego
Sysmex Astrego AB, a Uppsala-based company founded by Johan Elf, UU, has won the UK's prestigious Longitude Prize for its rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test. This system significantly advances clinical workflows for infectious diseases by quickly determining bacterial presence and antimicrobial efficacy from a urine sample. Patients' urine samples are examined inside nanofluidic chambers, in which the growth of the bacteria is is followed by microscopy. Image analysis of the data started as a user project with BIIF, involving former BIIF-member Petter Ranefall, who later joined Astrego full time. Congratulations from us to this success story!

## Vinnova Call "Use Infrastructures to Develop Precision Medicine"


Best regards  
Anna, in behalf of BIIF
