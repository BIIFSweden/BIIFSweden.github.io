Dear All,

Welcome to the latest edition of the BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) newsletter! 

## Call4Help
Our next [Call4Help session](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/bioimage-informatics/#biif-call4help) is coming up on **March 12, 9:30 – 11:30**. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project. For this we team-up with Sylvie Le Guyader, Head of the [LCI Microscopy Facility, KI](https://ki.se/en/bionut/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci?pk_vid=edc74ddcac41efbf16964996865aa670).  

Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.   

## GloBIAS News

### What is GloBIAS?
Exciting news: a new global non-profit association for bioimage analysis is in preparation: the Global BioImage Analysts’ Society (GloBIAS).   
GloBIAS seeks to connect **Bioimage Analysts, Life and Imaging Scientists** and **Bioimage Analysis Software Developers**. 
It continues the successful work done by NEUBIAS (Network of European Bioimage Analysts).

### GloBIAS survey
And GloBIAS needs your input! We would like to hear from you to get a better overview on the community of BioImage analysts, your wishes and ideas.  
Please contribute to shape the community by filling out this survey: [Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaI9wftr67J32IJQBIYJDhqjRcFBS-BHXMXa-qEG0kdc2QmA/viewform)
