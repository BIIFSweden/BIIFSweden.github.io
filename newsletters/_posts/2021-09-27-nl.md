Dear All,

We have a new Call4Help coming up – this Friday (1st October) 9:00. Register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9HqrfVC7n279RvTgbXa9RmQIlwsMwwuS9KBxOgyj_Ujg3eg/viewform).   
Please also note that we now accept **“fast-track” registrations**, whenever possible. 
This means that you can just register for the Call4Help session, without uploading a presentation/example data. 
We, however, still encourage to do the full registration including upload, so that we can prepare in a more targeted way to the data.

## SciLifeLab Fellows program survey
According to the SciLifeLab Fellows program survey, BIIF is the 3rd often used unit by SLL fellows! We are happy to see bioimage analysis being an important part in SLL projects.

## NBIS long-term support
You can apply for fully subsidized support in a Bio(image-)informatics Project via NBIS. The next deadline for application is this Friday, October 1st, but applications for NBIS Long-term Support are evaluated approximately every 4th month. 
Read more about it [here](https://www.nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php?form=longterm). For further questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the Bioinformatics Long-term Support directly at bioinformatics_wabi@scilifelab.se. 

Best regards,  
Anna, in behalf of BIIF
