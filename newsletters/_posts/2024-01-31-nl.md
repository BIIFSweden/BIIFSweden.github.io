Dear All,

Welcome to the latest edition of the BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) newsletter! 

## Open Position
We are looking for a new colleague, a **Bioinformatician with focus on research support within image analysis**!   
If you are enthusiastic about bioimage analysis, develop and use image analysis workflows and like to help researchers all over Sweden, this might be for you. Read more about the position [here](https://www.jobb.uu.se/details/?positionId=696993&languageId=1).

## Call4Help
We have planned for new [Call4Help sessions](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/bioimage-informatics/#biif-call4help), with the next session coming up on **February 20, 9:30 â€“ 11:30**. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project. For this we team-up with Sylvie Le Guyader, Head of the [LCI Microscopy Facility, KI](https://ki.se/en/bionut/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci?pk_vid=edc74ddcac41efbf16964996865aa670).  

Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.
