## New BIIF member
We are very happy that **Fredrik Nysjö** is joining us in BIIF! Fredrik will be starting working as a bioinformatician full-time with us in December.   
Fredrik has a background in image analysis and visualization, and in working with medical 3D image data. He defended his PhD thesis in 2020, which was about developing interactive methods for cranio-maxillofacial surgical planning. His other great interests include computer graphics and GPU programming. Welcome Fredrik! <img src="/images/FredrikNysjö.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

## Courses 

There are two courses coming up in which we are involved.

### Digital image analysis for scientific applications – focus MAX IV
The course aims at giving doctoral students and researchers from different disciplines a sufficient understanding of digital image processing and analysis techniques to solve basic image analysis problems. The content of the course includes methods especially suitable for MAX IV data. The course will also offer an introduction to several freely available software tools (e.g. CellProfiler, ImageJ, and ilastik), preparing the participants to start using computerized image analysis in their research.

Application deadline: December 15

### NBIS workshop in Neural Nets and Deep Learning
This course will give an introduction to the concept of Neural Networks (NN) and Deep Learning.  Topics covered will include:

-   NN building blocks, including concepts such as neurons, activation functions, loss functions, gradient descent and back-propagation
-   Convolutional Neural Networks
-   Recursive Neural Networks
-   Autoencoders
-   Best practices when designing NNs

Application Deadline: December 05

## Call4Help

The next Call4Help session is coming up on December 7, information [here](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/bioimage-informatics-call4help-6/).
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project.

## Funding via Euro-Bioimaging
Euro-Bioimaging opened a new funding opportunity for a grant of up to 5000 Euros. Since BIIF is part of Euro-Bioimaging funding can be used to apply for a Bioimage Analysis project with us. Project must be trans-national – so please spread this news with your European Collaborators that would like to use Image Analysis in their projects. More information [here](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/news/new-funding-opportunity-from-euro-bioimaging/).

Best regards
Anna, in behalf of BIIF
