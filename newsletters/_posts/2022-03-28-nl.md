## Call4Help

The next Call4Help session is coming up on **April 5, 9 – 12**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/event/bioimage-analysis-support-call4help-3/).
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project.

## Grant Calls

#### New chance to make project proposals to AIDA

The mission of AIDA is to contribute to putting AI innovations in diagnostic imaging to actual use in healthcare. This is, above all, done through the AIDA portfolio of subprojects from all over Sweden. There are several possibilities for support to efforts within AIDA’s scope: Partial funding up to 50%, access to technical infrastructure such as powerful computational systems, and access to a network of broad expertise. Currently, AIDA is soliciting proposals for [Innovation Projects](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-arena/apply-for-innovation-project/), [Clinical Fellowships]( https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-arena/apply-for-clinical-fellowship/) and [Clinical Evaluations](https://medtech4health.se/en/aida-arena/apply-for-clinical-evaluation/).  
**Deadline: April 19, 2022**.
