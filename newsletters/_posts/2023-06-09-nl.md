## Call4Help Webinar on steinbock.
We are organizing a Call4Help Webinar to showcase *steinbock*, next **Friday, June 16, 09:00-10:00**.  

Multiplexed imaging enables the simultaneous spatial profiling of dozens of biological molecules in tissues at single-cell resolution. Extracting biologically relevant information from multi-channel images involves computational tasks such as image segmentation and feature extraction, which can pose technology-specific challenges to experimental biologists lacking adequate bioinformatics training. 

In this hands-on webinar, we will showcase *steinbock*, a computational toolkit for batch-processing multiplexed tissue images using established tools and approaches, without the need for additional programming. The steinbock toolkit can be used to rapidly extract spatially resolved single-cell data for downstream statistical analysis, interfacing with popular analysis environments such as Python or R/Bioconductor. It is an essential part of the [Analysis workflow for IMC data](https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/IMCDataAnalysis/) (Bodenmiller Lab, ETH Zurich/University of Zurich) and further information can be found in the [steinbock online documentation](https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/steinbock/latest/).

The webinar will be given by **Jonas Windhager**, the creator and former maintainer of *steinbock*, who recently joined BIIF.  

**Date:** June 16, 09:00-10:00  
**Registration:** https://www.scilifelab.se/event/steinbock-a-toolkit-for-processing-multiplexed-tissue-images/

##  SciLifeLab Technology Survey  â€“ Open for Proposals on new Technologies and Units until August 10
We are pointing here to a call from SciLifeLab: 

SciLifeLab invites life science researchers and stakeholders within academia, healthcare, industry, and governmental organizations across Sweden to provide input to the development of the future SciLifeLab infrastructure from 2025 and beyond. SciLifeLab is interested in two types of proposals, both aiming at strengthening the current SciLifeLab infrastructure:

1) New cutting-edge technologies that are urgently needed by the user community
2) Existing local or national core-facilities that could be incorporated as new units into the SciLifeLab infrastructure from 2025

Proposals can be submitted via the web-based questionnaire, open from now on until August 10.  
More information [here](https://www.scilifelab.se/scilifelab-national-technology-survey-2023/). 
Questions about the SciLifeLab Technology Survey should be directed to infra@scilifelab.se
