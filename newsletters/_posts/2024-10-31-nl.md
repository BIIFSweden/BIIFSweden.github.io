Dear All,

welcome to our latest BIIF newsletter!

## ARISE2 call 
BIIF teamed up with Christian Tischer (EMBL Heidelberg) to offer a position within the Arise2 frame work, co-financed by SciLifeLab. 
ARISE2 is a fellowship program designed to train the next generation of research infrastructure experts through cutting-edge technology development, interdisciplinary collaboration, professional skills training, and career support. The jointly hosted scientist of the BIIF-connected project will work on spatial omics image data analysis, mainly located in Heidelberg, Germany and up to 9 month at SciLifeLab.

## BIIF at the I2K (Images to Knowledge) conference
Last week we participated at the I2K conference in Milan. Many new exciting tools were presented and it was great to see this thriving community. We highly recommend to join this conference next time if you have the chance!  
We teamed up with Frederic Ballllosera Navarro from Emma Lundberg's lab to hold a workshop on "Multiplexed tissue imaging: tools and approaches", featuring PIPEX, TissUUmaps, and SpatialData. You can find our workshop material [here](https://github.com/BIIFSweden/I2K2024-MTIWorkshop). Also keep your eyes open to the [I2K website](https://events.humantechnopole.it/event/1/), since often material of all workshops is published online.

## Publication on "The crucial role of bioimage analysts in scientific research and publication"
This publication took its start at the workshop "Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis" back in February this year, which I joined together with around 30 other bioimage analysts. The publication covers the roles of bioimage analysts and how they add value to the research community.  
The publication is open access and can be found [here](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/137/20/jcs262322/362545/The-crucial-role-of-bioimage-analysts-in).
