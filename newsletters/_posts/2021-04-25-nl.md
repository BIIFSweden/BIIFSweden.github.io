Dear All,  

we are organizing a new presentation on free and open-source tools as a follow-up of our short presentations in March. This time we will present ZeroCostDL4Mic, which is a toolbox for the training and implementation of common Deep Learning approaches to microscopy imaging. It exploits the ease-of-use and access to GPU provided by Google Colab. Read-up more about the toolbox [here]( https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki).
The webinar will be given by Petter Ranefall and will take place **May 4th , 09:00-10:00** (instead of our normal Call4Help session). There will be time for questions and discussion, so we hope this event to be very interactive. Please register [here]( https://forms.gle/XPdxEfpRnqZCbK6y7).
