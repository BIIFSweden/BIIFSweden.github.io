Dear All,

welcome to our latest BIIF newsletter!

## Open Positions @BIIF
**We are opening two positions!**  

A permanent **bioinformatician position** (6-month trial period) located at Uppsala University, Department of Computer Science.  
https://forum.image.sc/t/bioinformatician-with-focus-on-research-support-within-image-analysis-sweden/103181

**Research Software Engineer** position located at our KTH site in Stockholm Solna.  
This is a 1-year position, but there is a possibility to extend it to a permanent position after.

Please do get in contact for any question regarding the positions or working with BIIF.

## BIIF now joins the NBIS Drop-In sessions
**BIIF is now part of the NBIS Drop-In sessions!** 
The weekly drop-ins are open for anyone in Sweden doing academic research with questions about bio(image) informatics.  
Are you planning a new project? Are you stuck or need a second pair of eyes for some part of your analysis? Do you need help choosing the right bioimage analysis tool? We are happy to answer questions, small or large.  
You can find us as part of the weekly NBIS drop-in sessions over Zoom, as well as on site in Stockholm.  
Read more about the NBIS drop-in [here](https://nbis.se/get-support/talk-to-us).

## Gisele Miranda becomes SciLifeLab Fellow
After 5 years with BIIF, Gisele now starts her own group as a SciLifeLab Fellow.  
Gisele's group will leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques to advance the understanding of cellular behavior and interactions. Gisele will still be affiliated with BIIF in the future.   
**Congratulations!**  
Learn more about the Gisele's plans [here](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/gisele-miranda/).

## EVERSE Satellite Meeting and the 2024 International Research Software Funders Workshop 
In November, the SciLifeLab Data Centre (on behalf of SciLifeLab), the [European Virtual Institute for Research Software (EVERSE)](https://everse.software/) and the [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/) co-organized an EVERSE Satellite Meeting and the [2024 International Research Software Funders Workshop](https://adore.software/2024-international-research-software-funders-workshop/) in Uppsala. At the workshop, over 50 national and international funding organizations and infrastructure providers came together to discuss challenges in sustaining academic research software, highlighting the central role of [research software engineers ](https://researchsoftware.org/)(RSEs) and the need for long-term support. Research software development is an important and often overlooked part in bioimage informatics, for example when it comes to maintaining tools such as the BIIF-supported [TissUUmaps](https://tissuumaps.github.io/) software for visualizing spatial biology data. The BIIF therefore fully supports efforts in better recognizing research software development, and our bioimage analyst / research software engineer Jonas Windhager volunteered to co-facilitate at the workshop. You can read more about the event [here](https://www.scilifelab.se/news/scilifelab-and-data-centre-co-host-two-events-elevating-the-importance-of-research-software-in-sweden/).

## WABI Support Projects
The NBIS Bioinformatics Long-term Support offers extensive bioinformatics support to a limited set of scientifically outstanding projects. This support has been enabled primarily by a generous grant from Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW). The idea is simple: A senior bioinformatician will work in your project 500 hours for free. Hands-on involvement by the applying research group is strictly required to ensure efficient knowledge transfer.  
The deadline for the next regular round of applications is **Thursday, the 10th of October 2024**.
