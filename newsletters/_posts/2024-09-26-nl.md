Dear All,

welcome to our last newsletter before the summer break. 

## Open Positions @BIIF

## BIIF now joins the NBIS Drop-In sessions
BIIF is now part of the NBIS Drop-In sessions! The weekly drop-ins are open for anyone in Sweden doing academic research with questions about bio(image) informatics. Are you planning a new project? Are you stuck or need a second pair of eyes for some part of your analysis? Do you need help choosing the right bioimage analysis tool? We are happy to answer questions, small or large.
You can find us as part of the weekly NBIS drop-in sessions over Zoom, as well as on site in Stockholm. Read more about the NBIS drop-in [here](https://nbis.se/get-support/talk-to-us).

## Gisele Miranda becomes SciLifeLab Fellow
After 5 years with BIIF, Gisele now starts her own group as a SciLifeLab Fellow. Gisele's group will leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques to advance the understanding of cellular behavior and interactions. Gisele will still be affiliated with BIIF in the future. Congratulations! Learn more about the Gisele's plans [here](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/gisele-miranda/).
