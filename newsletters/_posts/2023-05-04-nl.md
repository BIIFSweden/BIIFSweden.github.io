## Call4Help
The next Call4Help session is coming up next Tuesday - **May 9, 10 â€“ 12am**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/call4help-form/). The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project.  
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis. 


## Publications
The developments on **TissUUmaps 3** have now been published! Check it out: [TissUUmaps 3: Improvements in interactive visualization, exploration, and quality assessment of large-scale spatial omics data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023025136). Please don't forget to cite it when you have been using TissUUmaps for your projects! Also, have a look on https://tissuumaps.github.io/ for recent developments and our [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9YMQ5Y0_1g).



## Courses
### EMBO Practical Course: Advanced methods in bioimage analysis
This advanced course concentrates on teaching cutting-edge concepts and tools for quantitative image analysis and will seek to upgrade the competencies of future bioimage analysis experts on both theoretical algorithm advancements as well as on practical implementation skills.
Modules/resources that will be covered:

*	Microscopy image quality control and image restoration
*	Advanced image segmentation and complex cell phenotyping
*	Handling large microscopy images (such as whole slide scans) and big N-dimensional data 
*	Neural-networks for image restoration, segmentation, and object classification.
*	Co-localisation and spatial statistics
*	Train the trainer: how to teach image analysis
