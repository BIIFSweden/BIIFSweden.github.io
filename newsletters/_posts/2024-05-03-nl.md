Dear All,

Welcome to the latest edition of the BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) newsletter! 

## Call4Help
Our next [Call4Help session](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/bioimage-informatics/#biif-call4help) is coming up on **May 13, 10:30 – 11:30**. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project. For this we team-up with Sylvie Le Guyader, Head of the [LCI Microscopy Facility, KI](https://ki.se/en/bionut/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci?pk_vid=edc74ddcac41efbf16964996865aa670).  

Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.   

## Welcome Kristína

We are welcoming Kristína Lidayová within BIIF!  


"Hej! I am originally from Slovakia, but my great sympathy for Sweden, Nordic nature and Astrid Lindgren led me to live in this country. I received my PhD in medical image analysis at Uppsala University, then focused on virus detection and developed methods for electron microscopy for a biotechnology company in Stockholm, and now I am the newest member of the BIIF, located in Uppsala. In my free time, I like to be active outdoors, be it hiking, climbing or paddling, or I sew my own outdoor equipment indoors."

## New Video: Next-generation bioimage file formats in spatial biology
Methods for biological imaging and in situ profiling of RNA and/or protein expression in biological tissue are rapidly evolving, pushing the limits of existing computational analysis infrastructure. To cope with increased computational demands, novel approaches for storing, accessing and sharing bioimaging data are currently emerging. In this practically-minded seminar, Jonas discusses ongoing community efforts in standardizing the next generation of bioimage file formats, facilitating the integration of bioimaging data with spatially resolved (e.g., single-cell) data.
We recorded the seminar and uploaded it to the [BIIF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bioimageinformaticsfacilit7287).

## Conferences
There are many conferences on bioimage analysis upcoming this year. Registration is open for these highlighted events: 

### Danish BioImaging Scientific Symposium
Our neighbor, the Danish BioImaging Network, is organizing a scientific symposiumin, in which you can learn more about Danish Bioimaging and latest image-based research.  
June 24-25, 2024, Copenhagen, Denmark.  
Information [here](https://www.danishbioimaging.dk/).

### I2K, From Images to Knowledge
Core of the I2K conferences are hands-on workshops focused on state-of-the-art open-source tools for working with and analyzing scientific image data. The conference will also offer insightful talks from leading voices in the field, alongside selected presentations from submitted abstracts.  
October 23-25, 2024, Milan, Italy.  
Information [here](https://www.i2kconference.org/).  
Workshop submission deadline: May, 15 2024.

### GloBIAS Bioimage Analysts Workshop
This workshop will be on sharing experience and methodolgoies in bioimage analysis education. The aim is to explore collectively the landscape of bioimage analysis tools.  
November 5-8, 2024, Göteborg.     
Information [here](https://www.globias.org/activities/annual-workshop-gothenburg-2024).  
Registration deadline: June 1, 2024.
