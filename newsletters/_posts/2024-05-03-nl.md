Dear All,

Welcome to the latest edition of the BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) newsletter! 

## Call4Help
Our next [Call4Help session](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/bioimage-informatics/#biif-call4help) is coming up on **May 15, 10:30 – 11:30**. The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project. For this we team-up with Sylvie Le Guyader, Head of the [LCI Microscopy Facility, KI](https://ki.se/en/bionut/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci?pk_vid=edc74ddcac41efbf16964996865aa670).  

Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.   

## Welcome Kristína

## New Video: Next-generation bioimage file formats in spatial biology
Methods for biological imaging and in situ profiling of RNA and/or protein expression in biological tissue are rapidly evolving, pushing the limits of existing computational analysis infrastructure. To cope with increased computational demands, novel approaches for storing, accessing and sharing bioimaging data are currently emerging. In this practically-minded seminar, Jonas discusses ongoing community efforts in standardizing the next generation of bioimage file formats, facilitating the integration of bioimaging data with spatially resolved (e.g., single-cell) data.
We recorded the seminar and uploaded it to the [BIIF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bioimageinformaticsfacilit7287).

## Conferences
This fall will be full of interesting bioimage analysis conferences and workshop. Registration is already already open for the following events:
