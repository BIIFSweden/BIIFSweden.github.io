Dear All,  

this month we highlight again many learning opportunities. We hope to see you in the sessions and courses!

## Call4Help 
The next Call4Help session is coming up next Tuesday - **March 7, 10 – 12am**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/call4help-form/). The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project.  
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.

## NEUBIAS
NEUBIAS is the Network of European BioImage Analyst and has been shaping the bioimage analysis community in Europe and beyond.
The Network has now received a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) with $327.000 over two years to secure the sustainability of NEUBIAS, establish strong connections to similar
initiatives, and share knowledge about state-of-the-art bioimage analysis tools and methods globally. NEUBIAS is a great resource for training material, e.g. on https://www.youtube.com/@NEUBIAS/videos

### NEUBIAS Training School - Defragmentation
The first NEUBIAS event in 2023: a training school for the new generation of bioimage analysts supported by EOSC-Life, Euro-Bioimaging, AI4Life and i3S.  
Topics: workflow-based image analysis and new integrated methods for cloud computing applied to life sciences.  
Porto, Portugal, May 08-12, 2023  
More information [here](https://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/training-schools/neubias-academy-home/defragmentation-training-school-2023/).

### NEUBIAS Open Symposium
Topics: Recent scientific developments and open tools in BioImage Analysis.  
Porto, Portugal, May 11-12, 2023  
More information [here](https://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/neubias2020-conference/portugal-2023/porto-overview-2023/)

## Courses
### Digital image analysis for scientific applications
This course aims at giving doctoral students and researchers from different disciplines sufficient understanding to solve basic computerized image analysis problems. 
The course will also offer an introduction to a number of freely available software tools, preparing the participants to start 
using computerized image analysis in their own research. The course will be in a hybrid format.    
More information available [here](https://www.teknat.uu.se/education/doctoral-studies/courses/faculty/2023-image-analysis-for-scientific-applications-digital/).   
**Extended application deadline: March 25, 2023**

## Published Course Material
### LCI microscopy course – From sample preparation to image analysis.
We have made the image analysis exercises from this year's LCI course available here: https://github.com/giselehbm/LCI_Workshop_2023.  
Have a look and learn how image quality affects image analysis: which artifacts can be corrected by image analysis and which cannot?
