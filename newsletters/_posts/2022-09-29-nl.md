The lecture slides, exercises and installation guidelines are now available [here]( https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/58516). The recorded lectures will be available once edited. 



## Apply for NBIS Bioinformatics Long-term Support 
The Bioinformatics Long-term Support offers extensive bioinformatics support to a limited set of scientifically outstanding projects. This support has been enabled primarily by a generous grant from Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW). The idea is simple: A senior bioinformatician will work in your project 500 hours for free.  

Deadline of the current round: 7 October 2022
