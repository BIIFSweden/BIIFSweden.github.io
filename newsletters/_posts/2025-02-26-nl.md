Dear All,

welcome to our latest BIIF newsletter!

## Courses
### EMBO Practical Course: "Advanced methods in bioimage analysis"
We are happy to announce that the application portal for the EMBO Practical Course: "Advanced methods in bioimage analysis" is now open! In the 2025 instance of the course, participants will learn about cutting-edge concepts for image analysis workflow and data management, how to use AI and natural language processing for image analysis, spatial statistics/omics integration - and much, much more. For each module, participants will learn both theoretical and practical aspects of the latest developments, and additional network to the international image analysis. Highly recommended, not only because we are involved in the organization ;).
