Dear All,

Welcome to the latest edition of the BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) newsletter! 

## Call4Help
The next Call4Help session is coming up next **Wednesday, November 8, 9:00 – 11:00**, information [here]( https://www.scilifelab.se/call4help-form/).
Note that you can always contact us under [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) to set-up a meeting and receive support on image analysis.   
The idea of the Call4Help session is to provide combined support on both the image analysis and the microscopy part of a project. For this we team-up with Sylvie Le Guyader, Head of the [LCI Microscopy Facility, KI](https://ki.se/en/bionut/live-cell-imaging-core-facility-lci?pk_vid=edc74ddcac41efbf16964996865aa670). 

## Publications
### An end-to-end workflow for multiplexed image processing and analysis

We had organized a Call4Help Webinar with Jonas presenting Steinbock earlier this year - the recordings are available on our [BIIF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bioimageinformaticsfacilit7287).

## Conferences

### DDLS Annual Conference 2023: The emerging role of AI in data-driven life science
This DDLS Annual Conference brings together the data-driven community in Life Science, introduces newly appointed DDLS fellows, and provides opportunities for networking across the research community and SciLifeLab infrastructures. The theme for 2023 is “the emerging role of AI in data-driven life science”. There will be presentations from DDLS fellows, and invited speakers on how they use AI in their research and their future visions. BIIF will contribute with a pre-conference introductory lecture on AI for imaging.

**Dates:** November 15 – November 16, 2023  
Registration and more info [here](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/ddls-annual-conference-2023/)

### BioVisionCenter Kick-Off Symposium, University of Zurich and online
The BioVisionCenter is a newly-created structure cofounded by the Friedrich Miescher Institute and the University of Zurich that aims at centralizing activities related to the processing of complex bioimage datasets. The BioVisionCenter has three missions consisting of 1) coordinating research in bioimage analysis, 2) fostering the development of standardized open-source resources, and 3) training the next generation of bioimage analysts. 
This kick-off Symposium aims at celebrating the launch of the BioVisionCenter by highlighting current initiatives for bioimage analysis and identifying opportunities to connect across the bioimage analysis community. The Symposium will feature invited talks from local stakeholders as well as national and international leaders in the field, and will offer ample time for networking and discussions. 

**Dates:** November 9 - November 10, 2023
