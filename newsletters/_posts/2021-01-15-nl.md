Dear All,

We hope you all had a good start into 2021! Here are news and upcoming events of BIIF.

For us the new year started with "moving in" to the SciLifeLab Bioinformatics Platform and with this we are in even closer interaction with [NBIS](https://www.nbis.se/). We are looking forward to this, but also to continued stimulating discussions with the SLL Bioimaging and Molecular Structure Platform!
  
# Support
You can always contact us via [biif@scilifelab.se](mailto:biif@scilifelab.se) for support on image analysis.

Additionally, we offer **Call4Help sessions**. Here we team up with Sylvie Le Guyader, LCI, Karolinska Institutet, to give combined **advice on both microscopy and image analysis**. 
The next Call4Help session is on February 2, 2021 – find more information [online](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/bioimage-informatics-call4help-9).

Also, do check out our [project database](https://biifsweden.github.io/) to get inspiration and examples of image analysis projects.
