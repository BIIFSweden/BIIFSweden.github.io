title: "Mapping Cancer Cell Infiltration and Migration in an Organoid Model"
author: ["Christophe Avenel"]
external: "Erik Samuelsson, Steven Edwards"
excerpt: "The objective of this study is to create a human cancer proliferation and progression model for glioblastoma. To create the model, cerebral organoids cultivated from human induced pluripotent stem cells were then cocultured with fluorescent reporter transduced glioma stem cell spheroids. After a set period of time, the organoid models were fixed, stained and cleared for imaging via light sheet microscopy. We wish to quantify the infiltration, migration and proliferation of said cancer cells within the organoid model over time in order to relate patient-derived cancer cells back to patient progression."

## Project Description
The objective of this study is to create a human cancer proliferation and progression model for glioblastoma. To create the model, cerebral organoids cultivated from human induced pluripotent stem cells were cocultured with fluorescent reporter transduced glioma stem cell spheroids. After a set period of time, the organoid models were fixed, stained and cleared for imaging via light sheet microscopy. We wish to quantify the infiltration, migration and proliferation of said cancer cells within the organoid model over time in order to relate patient-derived cancer cells back to patient progression.
